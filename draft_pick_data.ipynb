    "Assuming that a worker is not \"pulling their weight\" because of low UPH assumes that people generally don't want to perform well and puts this burden on the individual to fix the problem. This removes the responsibility from management to find bottle necks and other sources of delay that prevent workers from succeeding and also allows senior managers to erroniously compare disperate environments.\n",
