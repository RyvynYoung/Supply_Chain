# Project Inspiration:
“We manage what we measure, but frequently we measure what is easy.”

In my experience this is too frequently true and can be disastrous when done with metrics that are directly used to reward or penalize employees as is commonly done with UPH (units per hour) metrics for measuring employee productivity. This is an easy metric to calculate, how many units (boxes) did an employee move/get/create divided by the number of hours worked. However, it fails to account for many other factors that create variation in productivity. The type of items being picked, the size and weight, the location (transit time) involved, location (indoor/outdoor), the method of movement (motorized vs. walking), size of the area the items are located within, etc. are examples of physical variations that are independent of personal motivation to perform well. Even if these are controlled for, the tenure of the operator (amount of experience), number of hours worked per shift, etc. are additional factors that may impact performance that are also independent of motivation.

And, because this measure is easily obtained and communicated it is also frequently the only measure of performance that employees are made aware of with daily frequency and as a result becomes defined as the most important measure of successful performance. Frequently to the exclusion of accuracy or safety.

Could a model be built to create a more realistic productivity baseline where these additional factors are taken into account? Do these additional factors increase the accuracy of productivity prediction?

# Project Scope:
Based on publicly available data what is the baseline productivity predicted?
How accurate is the baseline?
Does adding additional features of tenure and shift length improve accuracy of model predictions?
